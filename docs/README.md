# ServisAku Platform Blueprint

**Goal:** Evolve the existing ServisAku codebase (React + Vite + Express + Prisma) into a
production-ready, multi-category home-services marketplace comparable to Urban Company —
**without a greenfield rebuild**. Maximize reuse of the current architecture; everything
here is an incremental path from the code as it exists today.

## Executive summary

ServisAku today is further along than a prototype: 33 lazy-loaded pages spanning consumer,
partner, and admin surfaces; a working Express + Prisma backend with JWT auth, escrow
ledger, refunds, payouts, chat, and notifications; a zod-validated service catalog for 3
categories; bilingual EN/BM; and a design-token system.

The distance to "Urban Company comparable" is **not** a rewrite — it is six workstreams:

1. **Harden** what exists (P0: unauthenticated entity routes; server-side validation; API versioning).
2. **Migrate SQLite → PostgreSQL early** (small schema now = cheap migration; unlocks the `Json` column type the whole service-abstraction design depends on — Prisma does not support `Json` on SQLite).
3. **Move the catalog from hardcoded JS into the database** and unify the two parallel catalog systems (`src/lib/catalog/` and `src/lib/packageData.js`).
4. **Build the marketplace mechanics** that don't exist yet: partner verification/KYC, availability, dispatch with expiring job offers, a real payment gateway, real-time transport.
5. **Expand categories through configuration** — 6 today → ~16 (cleaning, AC, appliance repair, plumbing, electrical, painting, pest, carpentry, handyman, smart home, water purifier, women's salon, men's grooming, spa & massage, and more).
6. **Layer growth features**: subscriptions, memberships, loyalty, referrals, dynamic pricing, QA photo verification, dispute workflows.

The stack decision is to **keep React + Express + Prisma** and prepare for React Native
mobile apps by making the REST API versioned, documented (OpenAPI), and token-refresh
capable — the API serves web and mobile alike.
